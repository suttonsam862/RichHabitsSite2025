I need to completely harden the payment intent creation process. Too many 400, 500, and 502 errors have occurred due to weak validation, unreliable session handling, and inconsistent request payloads. I want to make sure it’s technically impossible for any of these errors to happen again — even on mobile, bad Wi-Fi, or during concurrent requests.

✅ Stripe Intent Creation Must Follow This Sequence:
	1.	Form Validation (Client-Side & Server-Side)

	•	Validate all required fields (name, email, camp selection, amount, etc.)
	•	Block payment intent creation until all fields are valid and present
	•	Client-side must validate AND send a status to server — do not rely on frontend trust

	2.	Single Intent Rule

	•	A user can only generate one payment intent per session_id or registrant_id
	•	If one exists, retrieve it instead of creating a new one

	3.	Error-Handled Stripe Call

	•	Wrap Stripe API calls in try/catch with structured fallback
	•	On any 400, return a clear message to frontend:
“There was an issue creating your payment. Please refresh and try again.”
	•	On any 500/502, log full payload and error trace to payment_errors table with:
	•	timestamp
	•	request body
	•	IP address
	•	user agent
	•	session id
	•	Stripe response

	4.	Automatic Retry Logic (Server Side)

	•	Retry failed payment intent creation up to 3 times with short delay (250ms – 500ms)
	•	Log any persistent failure and alert dev or webhook if retry fails

	5.	Session Integrity Lock

	•	Create a locking system to prevent multiple simultaneous intent creations from different tabs/devices by same user

	6.	Fail-Safe Logging + Admin View

	•	Create a payment_errors table for ALL intent failures
	•	Admin dashboard should show timestamped error events by IP/session so we can debug patterns

	7.	Webhook Fallback Flow

	•	If a payment webhook is received but no registration exists, automatically:
	•	Insert placeholder registration record (recovered = true)
	•	Flag for admin review

❗ Non-Negotiable Outcome:

No user, on any device or browser, can trigger a payment intent creation unless everything is fully valid, properly sessioned, and no errors go unlogged. Every payment attempt is either successful, gracefully rejected with a clear message, or retried safely without duplication.
