You are a professional web developer refining the Rich Habits website in Replit. The site is already deep in development and needs final polish based on stakeholder feedback. Update the following sections according to this detailed punch list:

---

### 🔧 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Ensure all **missing images/render failures** are fixed on mobile and desktop views (especially on the “Our Team” and “Custom Apparel” pages).
- Confirm that all image assets are loading on both desktop and mobile using proper file extensions, alt tags, and responsive sizing.

---

### 🛠 PAGE-SPECIFIC TASKS

#### 🛍 Shop Page
- Copy the three **icon + tagline sections** from the Shop Coming Soon page:
  - ⚡️ **High Performance**
  - 💲 **Premium Quality**
  - ❤️ **Athlete Focused**
- Add these three icon+text elements **above or near the callout box** on the **Custom Apparel** page for consistency.

#### 🧵 Custom Apparel Page
- Fix **broken image containers** in the “Our Services” section (boxes are showing but images are not rendering).
- Make sure the following services have imagery next to them:
  - Custom Team Apparel
  - Wrestling Camps and Clinics
  - Premium Athletic Apparel

#### 👥 Our Team Page
- Fix image rendering issue for **Sam Sutton** and **Carter Vail** headshots or placeholder graphics.
- Confirm all bio text is legible on both desktop and mobile.
- Optionally add soft border or hover effect on cards for a premium feel.

#### 🧢 Featured Teams Section
- This section is on point. Keep the design but ensure logos or icons are added if available.
- Make sure this section is **also mirrored on the homepage or apparel landing page** for brand trust.

#### 📅 Events / Past Events Tab
- Add 2024 **Pickleball event** to the Past Events tab.
- Add a spot for **Slam Camp photos**, with a note to upload when available.

#### 🎯 Home Page (General)
- Reduce use of **Fruit Hunters** brand overlap or limit it to a dedicated Collabs page.
- Make the **Rich Habits logo or name larger** at the top of the homepage.
- Consider adding a **tagline** beneath the brand name.
- Ensure homepage doesn’t list camps twice: fix the mobile view that shows a **redundant camp list above the events list**.
- Lighten the **darkened header image overlays** so they are visible on mobile and desktop.

---

### 📱 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
- Adjust layout so users don’t have to scroll past all camps to reach apparel.
- Clean up mobile spacing on all sections mentioned above.

---

Once implemented, run full responsive checks across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Return nothing but **code or implementation summary** for each item when complete.
