We are facing an infinite loading spinner issue that persists even after all React, routing, and authentication logic has been bypassed. We’ve confirmed that the App component has been replaced with static content, and the AuthContext is hardcoded with `isLoading: false`. Despite this, the site still displays a blank white screen with a spinner. This confirms that the issue is not within React or Supabase, but originates from the static HTML loaded before React mounts. Please open `public/index.html` and inspect the contents of the `#root` div. You will see a hardcoded loading overlay element with class `loading-container`, containing a rotating `loading-spinner` div. This element is styled with full-screen fixed positioning and CSS animation. Because React is mounted with `createRoot(...)` and not `hydrateRoot`, React does not remove or replace the inner contents of the root DOM node during mount. Therefore, unless explicitly removed, the loading spinner inserted in the HTML will persist indefinitely and overlay the rendered React app. This is what’s causing the visual infinite loading loop. Please delete or comment out the `<div class="loading-container">...</div>` block from `public/index.html` so that the `#root` div is empty by default. Alternatively, wrap the spinner in a `<div id="startup-spinner">` and remove it manually with `document.getElementById('startup-spinner')?.remove()` in `main.tsx` before calling `createRoot(...)`. However, the simplest solution is to delete the static spinner entirely so that the React app has full control of the initial DOM content. This will resolve the issue. Confirm that after removing the hardcoded loader markup from the HTML, the spinner is gone and either your test component or app content appears as expected. Do not edit `client/index.html` — only modify the version in `public/index.html`, which is what the server actually serves during development and build. Once complete, restart the app and confirm the spinner is gone.
