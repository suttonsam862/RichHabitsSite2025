Fix the Rich Habits retail product detail pages. The following issues must be corrected exactly and efficiently:

---

⚠️ 1. MOBILE VIEW BROKEN

Issue:
- On mobile, the image gallery and product details overlap and do not fit screen properly
- The layout scrolls horizontally or renders clipped

Fix:
✅ Use a mobile-first responsive layout (flex-col, grid-cols-1 on small screens)
✅ Ensure image thumbnails wrap or scroll horizontally in a swipeable container
✅ Ensure product details (title, price, variant selectors, button) stack vertically on mobile
✅ Use Tailwind or CSS media queries to hide any overflow and fix spacing

---

⚠️ 2. SIZES NOT DISPLAYING

Issue:
- The “Size” selector is completely missing
- Products have multiple variants (Size, Color), but only color is shown

Fix:
✅ Display all variant options (Color, Size, etc.) using Shopify’s product data
✅ Render each `selectedOption.name` as a group of buttons (e.g., "Size": S, M, L, XL)
✅ When a Size is selected, update the `selectedVariant` based on all selected options
✅ Highlight selected Size and allow switching

---

⚠️ 3. ALWAYS SHOWS “OUT OF STOCK”

Issue:
- Even when variants are available, the UI shows “Out of Stock” and disables the Add to Cart button

Fix:
✅ Use `selectedVariant.availableForSale` (or `available`) from Shopify’s API
✅ If available, enable “Add to Cart” and remove “Out of Stock” notice
✅ If unavailable, disable button and show “Out of Stock” clearly
✅ Update availability status on variant change

---

✅ WHERE TO FIX:

1. Open `client/src/pages/ProductDetail.tsx`
2. Fix layout using responsive flex/grid classes or media queries
3. Display all variant options dynamically (including Size)
4. Update logic to match variant by all selected options (Color + Size)
5. Set `isInStock = selectedVariant.availableForSale === true`
6. Update button and label logic accordingly

---

Do not edit event/camp pages. Do not restructure routes. Focus only on the retail product detail view.

After completing the fix:
- ✅ Mobile view should render cleanly
- ✅ Size options should appear and respond
- ✅ Add to Cart should enable if variant is in stock
