Build a high-level, fully native analytics system that tracks visitor and registration activity from my custom front-end website and relays all essential traffic metrics into my Shopify Admin Dashboard, using only the Shopify API — no Google Analytics, no external integrations, no embedded third-party libraries.

⸻

✅ Phase 1: Shopify App Setup
	•	Create a custom private Shopify app or embedded app scoped for our store, with read/write access to metafields, admin dashboard sections, and custom reports.
	•	Authenticate using the latest Shopify Admin REST API (or GraphQL Admin API if preferred for performance).
	•	Configure the app to register a new custom admin section under “Apps” or a new left-nav item like “Site Metrics” in the Shopify dashboard.

⸻

✅ Phase 2: Data Capture & Relay Design
	•	Set up a lightweight logging system on our custom site (React/Node/Next/etc.) that triggers an internal endpoint (/log-visit) on every visit or key event.
	•	This endpoint should send the following JSON payload directly to the Shopify Admin API:

{
  "page": "/events",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-25T14:35:00Z",
  "session_id": "abc123-session",
  "utm_source": "instagram",
  "device_type": "mobile",
  "referrer": "https://google.com",
  "ip_address": "X.X.X.X"
}

	•	Batch the logs in memory or lightweight storage (e.g., local file, in-memory Redis, lightweight Postgres table).
	•	Every 5 minutes, aggregate and POST a summary payload to Shopify using the Admin API:
	•	total_visits_today
	•	bounce_rate_estimate
	•	utm_conversion_count
	•	mobile_vs_desktop_ratio
	•	top_referrers[]

⸻

✅ Phase 3: Shopify API Integration
	•	Use the Shopify Metafields API to store aggregated daily summaries on a dummy analytics resource like a custom_collection, product, or a custom metafield namespace (custom.site_metrics.*).
	•	Example: POST this to /admin/api/2023-10/metafields.json

{
  "metafield": {
    "namespace": "custom.site_metrics",
    "key": "daily_summary_2025_05_25",
    "value": "{ \"visits\": 142, \"bounce_rate\": 34, \"top_sources\": [\"Instagram\", \"Facebook\"] }",
    "value_type": "json_string"
  }
}

	•	For higher visibility, also inject these summaries into a Shopify Admin Dashboard Card using Polaris UI inside the custom app.

⸻

✅ Phase 4: Dashboard UX in Shopify
	•	Build a custom Polaris-based dashboard view using embedded app SDK:
	•	Graph daily visits
	•	Show UTM and traffic source breakdown
	•	Highlight spikes or dips in traffic
	•	Provide a toggle for team vs. individual registrations if applicable

⸻

Constraints:
	•	Do not use any third-party analytics libraries (Google Analytics, Amplitude, etc.)
	•	Do not rely on cookies or tracking scripts — all tracking must originate from server-side API calls or direct form inputs
	•	Use only Shopify Admin API and standard Polaris components for UI rendering
	•	Log errors in a fallback metafield (custom.site_metrics.errors) or internal logs[] table if relay fails
