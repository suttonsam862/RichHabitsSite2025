Rich Habits National Champ Camp — Las Vegas, June 4-7 | Rancho High School

The wrestling world converges on Rancho High School (1900 Searles Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89101) this June when Rich Habits rolls out its signature National Champ Camp. For four adrenaline-charged days (June 4-7, 9 AM – 3:30 PM) wrestlers aged 10 years old through high-school seniors will train under Penn State legends Vincenzo Joseph—two-time NCAA champion at 165 lbs (2017, 2018) ￼, Mark Hall—2017 NCAA champion and three-time finalist at 174 lbs ￼, and Jason Nolf—three-time NCAA champion at 157 lbs (2017-19) ￼. Their championship-proven systems, blended with Rich Habits’ high-energy culture, turn Rancho’s gym into a live laboratory where Southwest athletes learn elite setups, chain-wrestling sequences, and the championship mindset that powers Division I podium runs.

Capacity is limited to 200 campers to preserve low coach-to-athlete ratios. Each day layers intense positional drilling, live goes, and film-room breakdowns; a complete timetable appears beneath this description so parents and coaches can plan travel. Registration includes a custom National Champ Camp singlet, pro-shot highlight footage, and entry into Friday night’s Vegas Spotlight Match Showcase. Pricing is straightforward—$349 for the full camp or $175 per day—and programs that bring 10 or more wrestlers earn a 10 % credit on their next Rich Habits custom-gear order. Parents are welcome to watch sessions from the bleachers, and concessions will be available on-site throughout the week.
