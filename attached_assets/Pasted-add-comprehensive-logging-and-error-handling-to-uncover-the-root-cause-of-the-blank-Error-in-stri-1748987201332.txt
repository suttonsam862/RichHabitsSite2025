add comprehensive logging and error handling to uncover the root cause of the blank Error {} in stripe.confirmCardPayment—first, in your React entrypoint (e.g., src/App.jsx), log import.meta.env.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to verify the publishable key is not undefined (if it is missing, confirmCardPayment will silently fail)  ￼ ￼; next, in the checkout form component (e.g., src/components/CheckoutForm.jsx), wrap await stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret, { payment_method: { card: elements.getElement(CardElement), billing_details: { name, email, phone } } }) in a try/catch, and in both the if (error) branch and the catch block, log error.code, error.message, and the entire error object so you don’t just see a blank object (Stripe often returns a parameter_invalid_empty or invalid_client_secret error when billing details are missing or the client secret is malformed)  ￼ ￼; ensure that billing_details is nested under payment_method and that name and email are nonempty strings (omitting them can generate an empty Error {})  ￼ ￼; then, in your server route that creates the PaymentIntent (e.g., server/routes/create-payment-intent.js), add console.log('Creating PaymentIntent with:', { amount, currency }) before calling stripe.paymentIntents.create({ amount, currency }), and immediately after creation, check if (paymentIntent.last_payment_error) console.error('PaymentIntent last_payment_error:', paymentIntent.last_payment_error) so you capture any deeper Stripe‐side failures  ￼ ￼; also verify that the backend is using process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY correctly and that the currency parameter is valid, since omitting or misnaming it can cause the Intent to return a client secret but still fail on confirmation  ￼ ￼; next, create a quick Node script at test/testPayment.js that does const pi = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({ amount: 249, currency: 'usd' }); console.log('Created PI:', pi.id, pi.client_secret); await stripe.paymentIntents.confirm(pi.id, { payment_method: 'pm_card_cvc_fail' }); to force a known error and log its details (e.g., CVC failure) so you know the server key and environment are correct  ￼ ￼; redeploy your backend with these environment variables in place, then rerun the frontend (npm run dev or vite dev) and reproduce the payment error—inspect the browser console for detailed Stripe error codes and messages, and the server console for any last_payment_error logs  ￼ ￼; once you see the specific error (for example, “Invalid value for stripe.confirmCardPayment intent secret” or “parameter_invalid_empty: billing_details.email”), correct the missing or invalid field accordingly, then test again; this urgent, end‐to‐end approach will expose the true Stripe error instead of an empty Error {} and allow you to fix the payment setup immediately.
