## üõ†Ô∏è PHASE 2 ‚Äì IMPLEMENT ALL FLAGGED FIXES FROM AUDIT

Address the following flagged issues:

‚úÖ 1. **Remove ALL fallback logic**
- Eliminate `eventSlugToIdMap || 1` or any use of fallback event names
- Ensure all pricing, payment, and registration logic relies on real event records

‚úÖ 2. **Fix Product Detail Routing**
- Route should be `/shop/:handle` (not `/shop/product/:handle`)
- Match `<Link>` targets to the correct route
- Confirm `/shop/:handle` dynamically loads the product with correct image and pricing

‚úÖ 3. **Implement Product Detail Routing**
- Add a `<Route path="/shop/:handle" component={ProductDetail} />` if not already present

‚úÖ 4. **Fix Cart Page Link and Button**
- Fix ‚ÄúContinue Shopping‚Äù link on `/cart` to point to `/shop` (not `/products`)
- Ensure the cart badge reflects accurate item count in header

‚úÖ 5. **Fix Cart Checkout Endpoint**
- Ensure POST `/api/cart/checkout` creates a valid Shopify checkout or draft order
- Validate variant IDs and quantities
- Return a working `checkoutUrl`

‚úÖ 6. **Variant Image Switching**
- Ensure selecting a variant (e.g., color) updates the main product image
- Fallback to first product image if variant has none
- Use Shopify‚Äôs `variant.image` properly

‚úÖ 7. **Remove Unused/Mock Event Logic**
- Delete any use of `mockEvent`, `fakeEvent`, or `defaultEventName`
- Log and reject any payment that lacks a verified `eventId` in the DB

‚úÖ 8. **User Management Panel**
- If missing, implement an `/admin/users` view
- Include buttons: Edit, View, Reset Password (functional)
- Ensure list loads via JWT auth, not session
- Secure API with proper auth middleware

‚úÖ 9. **Enable JWT Auth**
- Issue JWT on login
- Store token securely
- Protect all admin routes using Authorization headers

‚úÖ 10. **Confirm All Stripe Payments are Secure**
- Ensure webhook fails if eventId or registrationId is missing
- Confirm `shopifyOrderId` is stored for all event payments
- Ensure duplicate webhooks are ignored (idempotent)

## üíæ AFTER FIXES
- Confirm `/shop` shows retail products with working add-to-cart
- Confirm `/cart` shows accurate cart and performs checkout
- Confirm `/register/:slug` leads to event registration and triggers real payment + order
- Confirm Stripe charges are tied to actual event IDs and metadata
- Confirm Shopify draft orders are created with correct product/variant details

---

Start by:
1. Refactoring the server routes into `/routes/events.ts` and `/routes/retail.ts`
2. Removing fallback `eventId || 1` from all pricing/payment functions
3. Updating router to support `/shop/:handle` and dynamic product loading

Then proceed to fix all flagged items above.
