# Shopify Order Integration Diagnostic Report

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Stripe Webhook Endpoint Registration
The Stripe webhook handler `handleStripeWebhook` exists in `server/stripe.ts` but was **never registered as an endpoint** in `server/routes.ts`. This prevented Stripe from notifying the system when payments succeeded, breaking the automatic Shopify order creation flow.

## Complete Flow Trace

### Expected Flow
1. User submits registration form
2. Stripe processes payment successfully
3. Stripe sends `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook to `/api/stripe-webhook`
4. Server receives webhook, calls `handleStripeWebhook` function
5. Function calls `createShopifyOrderFromRegistration` with form data
6. Shopify order created via Admin REST API with note_attributes containing all form fields

### Actual Flow (Before Fix)
1. User submits registration form ✓
2. Stripe processes payment successfully ✓
3. **BROKEN**: No webhook endpoint registered - Stripe webhooks ignored
4. **BROKEN**: `handleStripeWebhook` never called
5. **BROKEN**: No Shopify orders created
6. Payment succeeds but no order record in Shopify

## Files and Line Numbers Involved

### Stripe Webhook Handler (server/stripe.ts)
- **Lines 620-750**: `handleStripeWebhook` function processes payment_intent.succeeded events
- **Lines 750-850**: `createShopifyOrderFromRegistration` builds registration data and calls Shopify API
- **Lines 885-920**: Extracts form fields (name, grade, shirt size, contact info) into registration object
- **Lines 920-950**: Creates Shopify order with complete form data as note_attributes

### Shopify API Integration (server/shopify.ts)
- **Lines 830-988**: `createShopifyDraftOrder` function using Admin REST API
- **Lines 870-910**: Maps form fields to note_attributes for order tracking
- **Lines 913-951**: Creates draft order, then completes it as paid status
- **Authentication**: Uses X-Shopify-Access-Token header with Admin API access token

### Route Registration (server/routes.ts)
- **Line 45**: Import statement for `handleStripeWebhook` added
- **Lines 138-140**: Webhook endpoint registration with raw body parser for signature verification

## Shopify API Configuration

### API Type: Admin REST API 2023-07
- **Endpoint**: `https://{SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN}/admin/api/2023-07/draft_orders.json`
- **Authentication**: X-Shopify-Access-Token (verified present in environment)
- **Method**: Draft order creation → completion to paid status
- **Form Data Storage**: note_attributes array with all registration fields

### Environment Variables Status
- SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN: Present ✓
- SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN: Present ✓
- SHOPIFY_API_KEY: Present ✓
- SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN: Present ✓

## Fix Implementation Status

### Completed Repairs
1. **Added webhook endpoint registration** (Line 140, routes.ts)
   ```typescript
   app.post('/api/stripe-webhook', express.raw({type: 'application/json'}), handleStripeWebhook);
   ```

2. **Added raw body parser** for webhook signature verification
   - Required for Stripe webhook security validation
   - Prevents webhook replay attacks

3. **Import statement added** for webhook handler function
   - Links the existing handler to the route registration

## Testing and Verification

### Immediate Testing Required
1. **Configure Stripe webhook URL**: Set `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe-webhook` in Stripe dashboard
2. **Enable payment_intent.succeeded event** in Stripe webhook configuration
3. **Test with real payment** to verify complete flow
4. **Monitor server logs** for "Creating Shopify order with registration data" messages

### Expected Log Sequence (After Fix)
```
Payment succeeded: pi_xxxxx
Using registration data from payment intent metadata
Creating Shopify order with registration data: {name, email, phone, etc}
Successfully created Shopify order: {order_id}
```

## Form Data Flow Verification

### Registration Fields Mapped to Shopify
- **Customer Info**: firstName, lastName, email, phone → Shopify customer object
- **Event Details**: eventId, registrationType, day1/day2/day3 → note_attributes
- **Personal Info**: grade, tShirtSize, schoolName, clubName → note_attributes  
- **Contact Info**: contactName (parent/guardian) → note_attributes
- **Payment Info**: stripePaymentIntentId, amount → order metadata

### Shopify Order Structure
```json
{
  "draft_order": {
    "customer": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe", 
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "555-123-4567"
    },
    "note_attributes": [
      {"name": "T_Shirt_Size", "value": "M"},
      {"name": "Grade", "value": "9th"},
      {"name": "School", "value": "Test High School"},
      {"name": "Contact_Name", "value": "Parent Name"}
    ],
    "financial_status": "paid",
    "tags": "Rich Habits Event, Stripe, Online Registration"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Requirements

### Production Webhook Configuration
1. **Stripe Dashboard**: Add webhook endpoint URL
2. **Webhook Events**: Enable `payment_intent.succeeded`
3. **Webhook Secret**: Set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable for signature verification
4. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS for webhook endpoint security

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Issues (Resolved)
- Missing webhook endpoint registration → **FIXED**
- No automatic order creation → **FIXED**
- Form data not passed to Shopify → **FIXED**

### Medium Risk Issues (Monitor)
- Webhook signature verification requires STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in production
- Network timeouts during high-volume registration periods
- Shopify API rate limits during event registration rushes

## Success Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Order Creation Rate**: 100% of successful payments should create Shopify orders
2. **Data Completeness**: All form fields should appear in Shopify note_attributes
3. **Response Time**: Webhook processing should complete within 10 seconds
4. **Error Rate**: Less than 1% webhook processing failures

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Deploy the fix** to production environment
2. **Configure Stripe webhook** with new endpoint URL
3. **Test with small payment** to verify complete flow
4. **Monitor logs** for successful order creation messages
5. **Verify Shopify dashboard** shows new orders with complete form data
