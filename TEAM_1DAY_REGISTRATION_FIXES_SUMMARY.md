# Team Registration and 1-Day Registration Fixes - Complete Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives Accomplished

### âœ… 1. Fixed /api/team-registration endpoint
- **Team Contact Records**: Now properly creates `teamContact` records with coach name and email
- **Field Mapping**: All athlete records properly map frontend fields to database:
  - `tShirtSize â†’ shirt_size`
  - `parentName â†’ parent_name` 
  - `parentPhoneNumber â†’ phone`
  - `experienceLevel â†’ experience`
  - `age/grade â†’ grade`
- **Team Data**: Properly saves `teamName`, `schoolName`, and `eventId`
- **Registration Type**: All team entries correctly receive `registrationType: 'team'`

### âœ… 2. Shopify Integration for Team Registrations
- **Coach as Customer**: Uses coach's name and email as the customer
- **Single Order**: Creates one Shopify draft order with line item: `"Team Registration â€“ [Team Name]"`
- **Correct Pricing**: Quantity = number of athletes, Price = total team price
- **Traceability**: Saves `shopifyOrderId` in all athlete records
- **Order Creation**: Successfully tested with orders #6319961211117, #6319961932013, #6319962390765

### âœ… 3. 1-Day Registration Logic
- **Pricing**: 1-day registrations priced at exactly 50% of full event fee
- **Day Selection**: Supports `selectedDates` array for chosen days
- **Shopify Labels**: Creates orders with `"1-Day Camp Registration â€“ [Event Name]"`
- **Database Support**: Added `stripe_payment_intent_id` and `shopify_order_id` columns

### âœ… 4. Clean Route Architecture
- **Unified Endpoint**: `/api/events/:eventId/create-payment-intent` handles all registration types
- **Pricing Logic**: Centralized in `pricingUtils.ts` with proper 1-day calculations
- **Team vs Individual**: Automatically calculates team pricing (individual price Ã— athlete count)

### âœ… 5. Webhook Integration
- **Registered**: Stripe webhook handler properly registered at `/api/stripe-webhook`
- **Payment Processing**: Team registrations marked as paid after Stripe payment
- **Email Triggers**: Confirmation emails sent to coach's email address
- **Shopify Creation**: Automatic draft order creation with correct labels
