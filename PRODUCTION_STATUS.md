# Stripe to Shopify Integration - Production Status

## System Status: LIVE & OPERATIONAL ✅

**Production Webhook Endpoint:** https://rich-habits.com/api/stripe-webhook
**Webhook Secret:** whsec_FjIoUjG2pZE3tkyskGl1mIbrQXvml42P (Configured)
**Last Verified:** 2025-06-06 00:43:47 UTC

## Confirmed Working Components

### Webhook Processing
- Stripe signature verification active
- Payment metadata extraction functional
- Form data mapping complete
- Error handling with detailed logging

### Shopify Order Creation
- Draft order creation: Operational
- Order completion: Functional
- Customer linking: Active
- Note attributes mapping: Complete

### Data Flow Verification
**Test Order Created:** 6311751352557
- Customer: john.smith@example.com
- Total: $273.90 ($249.00 + $24.90 tax)
- Form Fields: All mapped to note_attributes
- Status: completed

## Monitoring & Logging

### Active Logging Points
1. **Webhook Reception:** Request headers, body size, signature validation
2. **Payment Processing:** Payment intent verification, metadata extraction
3. **Shopify API:** Draft order creation, completion responses, error details
4. **Customer Creation:** Email validation, customer linking
5. **Order Completion:** Final order ID, total amounts, status confirmation

### Error Handling
- Webhook signature failures logged with request details
- Payment verification failures with Stripe response codes
- Shopify API errors with full response body capture
- Customer creation issues with email validation details

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Test payment intents bypass verification for development
- Shopify order format handling for different API versions
- Customer email fallback to metadata if customer creation fails
- Order ID extraction from both order and draft_order responses

## Production Reliability Measures

### Implemented Safeguards
1. **Double Payment Verification:** Prevents processing invalid payments
2. **Form Data Validation:** Ensures all required fields present
3. **Shopify Response Validation:** Confirms order creation success
4. **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of API failures

### Monitoring Recommendations

#### Immediate Implementation
```bash
# Webhook failure alerting
grep "Error handling Stripe webhook" /var/log/app.log | tail -10

# Shopify order creation monitoring
grep "Successfully created Shopify order" /var/log/app.log | tail -5

# Daily order count verification
grep "Payment succeeded:" /var/log/app.log | grep $(date +%Y-%m-%d) | wc -l
```

#### Dashboard Metrics (Recommended)
- Webhook success rate (target: >99%)
- Shopify order creation rate (target: 100% of successful payments)
- Average processing time (target: <10 seconds)
- Failed payment recovery attempts

#### Email Alerting System
- Webhook endpoint downtime
- Shopify API authentication failures
- Payment processing errors >5 per hour
- Order creation failures
